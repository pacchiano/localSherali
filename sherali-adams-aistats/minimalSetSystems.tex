%Here we address the question of when is a set system $\mathcal{S}$ minimal. In the following sense:


Given $f : \{-1,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, what is the minimal -ordered by containment- set system $\mathcal{S}$ that is needed so that $\mathbb{L}_{\mathcal{S}}$ achieve the same value as $\mathbb{L}_k$. For $k=2, 3$ we have the following results:

\begin{theorem}[Extension result for $\mathbb{L}_2$, $\mathbb{L}_3$ ]

\end{theorem}


We conjecture that this result does not hold for $k=2,3$.
